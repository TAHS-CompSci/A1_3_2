## Creating Variables

Create a variable 'guess'. This variable is to be assigned a value from 1-100. 

## Creating Functions

Create a function 'hiLo_game'. This function will pull in an arguement 'guess'. Create a new variable 'change' inside of function 'hiLo_game'. Create an expression that will change guess to something else - you choose. Print 'change' to see that your variables and functions are working correctly.
